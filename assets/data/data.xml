            <description>After reconstructing the color patterns of a well-preserved dinosaur from China, researchers have found that the long-lost species Psittacosaurus (meaning &quot;parrot lizard,&quot; a reference to its parrot-like beak) was light on its underside and darker on top. <!-- more --></description>

            <description>Why do some foodborne bacteria make us sick?

            <description>Millions of years ago, the ancestor of modern rattlesnakes was endowed with a genetic arsenal of toxic weaponry. But in a relatively short period of evolutionary time, different types of snakes kept different types of toxin genes, and shed others. <!-- more --></description>

            <description>If you bottle up a gas and try to image its atoms using today&#039;s most powerful microscopes, you will see little more than a shadowy blur. Atoms zip around at lightning speeds and are difficult to pin down at ambient temperatures. If, however, these atoms are plunged to ultracold temperatures, they slow to a crawl, and scientists can start to study how they can form exotic states of matter, such as superfluids, superconductors, and quantum magnets. <!-- more --></description>

            <description>Like many predators, the fringe-lipped bat primarily uses its hearing to find its prey, but with human-generated noise on the rise, scientists are examining how bats and other animals might adapt to find their next meal. According to a new study, when noise masks the mating calls of the bat&#039;s prey, túngara frogs, the bat shifts to another sensory mode -- echolocation. <!-- more --></description>

            <description>A black hole destroying a star, an event astronomers call &#039;stellar tidal disruption,&#039; releases an enormous amount of energy, brightening the surroundings in an event called a flare. Two new studies characterize tidal disruption flares by studying how surrounding dust absorbs and re-emits their light, like echoes. This approach allowed scientists to measure the energy of flares from stellar tidal disruption events more precisely than ever before. <!-- more --></description>

            <description>Lakes and snowmelt-fed streams on Mars formed much later than previously thought possible, according to new findings. The recently discovered lakes and streams appeared roughly a billion years after an earlier era of wet conditions on ancient Mars. These results suggest the surface conditions at this later time may also have been suitable for microbial life on the Red Planet. <!-- more --></description>

            <description>Astronomers have captured the sharpest, most detailed observations of a comet breaking apart 67 million miles from Earth, using NASA&#039;s Hubble Space Telescope. The images suggest that the roughly 4.5-billion-year-old comet, named 332P/Ikeya-Murakami, or comet 332P, may be spinning so fast that material is ejected from its surface. The resulting debris is now scattered along a 3,000-mile-long trail, larger than the width of the continental United States. <!-- more --></description>

            <description>New data from ALMA reveal that the black hole at the center of a galaxy named NGC 1068 is actually the source of its own dusty torus of dust and gas, forged from material flung out of the black hole&#039;s accretion disk. <!-- more --></description>

            <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/09/160915120347.htm</link>
            <description>Many galaxies are found to have an extremely bright core powered by a supermassive black hole. These cores make &quot;active galaxies&quot; some of the brightest objects in the Universe. They are thought to shine so brightly because hot material is glowing fiercely as it falls into the black hole, a process known as accretion. This brilliant light can vary hugely between different active galaxies, so astronomers classify them into several types based on the properties of the light they emit. <!-- more --></description>

            <description>For more than 20 million years, the ups and downs of diversity in terrestrial large mammals were determined by primary production, i.e. net production of plant biomass. This pattern changed with the onset of the ice ages. The reason for this is likely the beginning of human impact on nature, according to a new research. Based on 14,000 fossils, the scientists reconstructed the diversity of terrestrial large mammals and compared it with data on the biomass production of plants during the same time period. <!-- more --></description>

            <description>Intelligence -- and not just relentless practice -- plays a significant role in determining chess skill, indicates a comprehensive new study. The research provides some of the most conclusive evidence to date that cognitive ability is linked to skilled performance -- a hotly debated issue in psychology for decades -- and refutes theories that expertise is based solely on intensive training. <!-- more --></description>

            <description>Eggs can be &#039;tricked&#039; into developing into an embryo without fertilization, but the resulting embryos, called parthenogenotes, die after a few days because key developmental processes requiring input from sperm don&#039;t happen. However, scientists have developed a method of injecting mouse parthenogenotes with sperm that allows them to become healthy baby mice with a success rate of up to 24 per cent. <!-- more --></description>

            <description>Astronomers using Hubble have been able to study stellar evolution in real time. Over a period of 30 years dramatic increases in the temperature of the star SAO 244567 have been observed. Now the star is cooling again, having been reborn into an earlier phase of stellar evolution. This makes it the first reborn star to have been observed during both the heating and cooling stages of rebirth. <!-- more --></description>

            <description>Several large international groups of researchers report data that more than doubles the number of sites in the human genome tied to blood pressure regulation. One of the studies turned up unexpected hints that biochemical signals controlling blood pressure may spring from within cells that line blood vessels themselves. <!-- more --></description>

            <description>A warming climate is causing earlier springs and later autumns in eastern forests of the United States, lengthening the growing season for trees and potentially changing how forests function. Scientists have found that in years with early springs, trees use more nitrogen to grow than is naturally provided in soil, which could impact tree growth rates and the amount of carbon dioxide forests take out of the atmosphere. <!-- more --></description>
